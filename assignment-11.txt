#+begin_note
  How does allowing cycles imply the existence of more than one path from one
  graph node to another?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
If you have a cycle in a graph that means that you will always have multiple paths from that
node to another becuase you can always sycle back.

  Do some research and figure out where graphs are used in your major, and describe
  how a knowledge of graph theory can be beneficial to you in the future.

#+begin_info
Within machine learning we use neural networks all of the time. These are directional
graphs.

#+begin_note
  Choose a link in the directed tournament graph (figure 62 in HTC). Use all of
  the /directed adjacency/ vocabulary to describe it.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
Let k be the link that comes from A and goes to B.
A is adjacent to B and B is adjacent from A.
k conneccts A and B.
K goes from A to B.
A is te initia node of k.
B in the erminal noe of k.

#+begin_note
  List in lisp form all the simple paths (in both representations) from =MT= to
  =NM=, identifying the shortest path(s) and the longest path(s).

#+begin_note
  Directed graphs (/digraphs/ for short) can represent binary relations. Make a
  connection between the four relation types and the existence or non-existence
  of certain features in the graph of the relation.

  - Reflexive = /every/ node has a link that is a loop.
  - Symmetric = there are /no/ single link arrows (one-way trips) --- every link
    arrow is a double one (roundtrip).
  - Antisymmetric = there is /no/ double arrow (going both ways) /unless/ it is
    a loop.
  - Transitive = there is /no/ two-leg journey (think flight with a layover)
    without a shortcut (non-stop flight).

  It is helpful to draw a graph of a relation that is described more abstractly.
  For an example of an abstract description, here is the relation on the set [1
  2 3] given by this vector of \ldquo{}conses\rdquo (another way to say /dotted pairs/)
  representing the ordered pairs:

  [(1 . 1) (1 . 2) (2 . 2) (3 . 3)]

  The three-node four-link graph of that relation appears in [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#outline-container-org53bfa2d][section VWF]].

  Identify which features listed above this graph has. Draw the digraphs of some
  other abstract binary relations, with and without the four features.

#+begin_note
  In another multigraph example, what is the connection between [the \ldquo{}four nodes
  seven links\rdquo] graph and the \ldquo{}birth of graph theory\rdquo?

  What do its nodes and links represent? What is its degree sequence?

  Explore the graph property \ldquo{}Eulerian\rdquo. Does this graph have it? Describe
  necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Eulerian.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
It is simalar because there are loops in the graph.
degree sequence = [5 3 3 3]
The birth of graph theroy does not represent eulerian properties because it is not a closed
loop, or has a tail. The other graph does not have any sort of tail.

  Explore the question: Does a graph\rsquo{}s degree sequence alone contain enough
  information to reconstruct the graph?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
No, if you were to look at the degree sequene [1 1 1 1 1] how do you know
whih node connects to which one.

   Why is that? Give a succinct argument justifying that the degrees of all the

  Is there (can there exist) a simple graph with degree sequence =[3 2 1 0]=?
  Justify your answer.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
No it can not. If you look at the node with 3 connections there are only 2 other
node with avalible connections. You would have to connect it to itself.
#+end_info

  List in lisp form (using the shorter representation) all the directed paths in
  the tournament graph from node =A= to node =F=. How many of these paths

* Puzzles
  No puzzles again this week. Work on GPAOs instead! (If you have finished all
  those seen so far, pick one from the endnotes of the book, and describe what
  you did with it.)
