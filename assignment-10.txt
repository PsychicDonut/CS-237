#+begin_note
  Why do 17 characters require 5 bits per character for a fixed-length encoding?
  What in general is required for /n/ different characters?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
Because if you build a balanced tree from 17 characters then max travel length
Should be 5.

* Problems
  No optional problems this week.

  Use the tree and the code given below to decode the message
  =00010010000111010111011011010111100110000010111101100011101011110=.

  Best would be to write a =decode= function that has the same signature as
  =find-leaf= and calls =find-leaf= as a helper function.

  Now decode the longer message
  =0001001000111001110101110110110101111001100000101111011000111010111100111=
  and explain the reason for the perhaps surprising result.

#+begin_info
I think that there are extra characters in the second string of 0s and 1s strung in the message.
This will lead the tree to grab extra " " when you do not want them. I also noticed that there is
an extra space at the end of the list.

#+begin_note
  What is the tie-breaking rule used when deciding where to insert into the
  queue in this Huffman tree construction? Implement this rule in elisp code,
  and compare it to the one used by [[http://huffman.ooz.ie][this tool]]. Does it matter what tie-breaking
  rule you use? Why or why not?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
The rule that we discussed in class was all about the order in which you added an element.
If you created a new element from smaller elements and there was a previous element that
was placed earlier then your new element goes after that element.
I think what is happening with the tree in the tool is that they are flipping that rule.
They add the element before the previously added element.

  Construct the Huffman tree for and build the bitstring encoding the string
  "cookbooknook".

  What is the average number of bits per character with this encoding?

  What is the compression ratio achieved using this tree\rsquo{}s encoding of
  the string?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
Average number of bits = 2.33333
Compression ratio = .2222222 or 22.22%

  Context from STK (with one minor change in the code):

  We now revisit the problem of representing trees in elisp. The following code
  shows a possible implementation of a tree node as a symbol, which exploits the
  versatile structure of a symbol. The symbol’s value is the node’s value —
  which can be any lisp object. The symbol’s plist (property list) is used for
  storing the “pointers” to (the symbols of) the left and right children, /and/
  the parent of that symbol-node. Note that this is specific to binary trees,
  but the technique can be extended to arbitrary trees.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (require 'cl)

  (defun get-value (node)
    (and (symbolp node) (symbol-value node)))

  (defun set-value (node new-value)
    (and (symbolp node) (set node new-value)))

  (defun get-parent (node)
    (and (symbolp node) (get node :parent)))

  (defun set-parent (node parent)
    (and (symbolp node) (symbolp parent) (put node :parent parent)))

  (defun get-left (node)
    (and (symbolp node) (get node :left)))

  (defun set-left (node left)
    (and (symbolp node) (symbolp left) (put node :left left)))

  (defun get-right (node)
    (and (symbolp node) (get node :right)))

  (defun set-right (node right)
    (and (symbolp node) (symbolp right) (put node :right right)))

  (defun try-it-out ()
    (setq a 1 b 2 c 3)
    (put 'a :right 'b)
    (put 'a :left 'c)
    (put 'c :parent 'a)
    (put 'b :parent 'a)
    (list a (symbol-plist 'a)))

  (setq node-counter 0)

  (defun make-node ()
    (let ((symbol (intern (concat "n" (number-to-string node-counter)))))
      (set symbol node-counter)
      (incf node-counter)
      (setf (symbol-plist symbol) nil)
      symbol))

  No puzzles again this week. Work on GPAOs instead! (If you have finished all
  those seen so far, pick one from the endnotes of the book, and describe what
